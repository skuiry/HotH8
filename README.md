**TastyHealth** is the project that we worked on during Hack of the Hill 8. TastyHealth promotes healthy living by providing recipes for healthy yet hearty dishes.
Utilizing Python's Beautiful Soup's web-scraping capabilities and combining it with mySQL's database functionality, users can input the type of dish they are looking for as well as 
the number of calories they want to limit themselves. Immediately, the program will access a database with over 400 tasty recipes and return ones which would fit the user's requirements.
### Who said eating healthy couldn't taste good?
